D: embedding dimension
P: dropout probability
C: num. of classes

DROPOUT P%
GCNConv 32 x C

D IN [16, 32, 64, 128]
P IN [0.3, 0.5, 0.7]
TRAIN SPLITS IN [0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5]
K = 1
50 EVALS EACH
LR = 0.01


CONCLUSIONS:
EMBEDDING SIZE > IS BETTER (UNTIL 128)
DROPOUT 50% AND 70% BETTER THAN 30%
TRAIN SPLIT ANALYSIS STILL VALID
FOR THE CRITICAL CLASS F1-SCORE,
THE INF AND SUP TOLS HAVE IMPACT


NEXT STUDY: FIXED DROPOUT AT 50%, EMBEDDING SIZE AT 128
